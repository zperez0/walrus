## Description

_In this website I learned how to use jQuery methods such as .toggle(), .hide(), .show() in order to hide and show an image. I used span tags to limit the scope of CSS and JavaScript. I used classes for elements that show up throughout the web page. I used IDs for elements that only show up once. I used CSS to display a specific color to the "click here" link. I also changed the cursor to pointer._
